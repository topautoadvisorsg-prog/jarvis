# J.A.R.V.I.S — Voice + HUD for Hermes Agent

A self-hosted, Iron-Man-style voice assistant and command center built on top of
[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (NousResearch's
open-source autonomous agent). Talk to a *real* agent — one with persistent
memory, terminal access, web search, file tools, and 80+ skills — through a
glowing arc-reactor HUD in any browser on your LAN, or a push-to-talk client.

**Everything runs on your own hardware.** The only cloud calls are your LLM
provider (via Hermes) and ElevenLabs for the voice. Speech-to-text is fully
local (Whisper on CPU).

## Demo

[![Watch the J.A.R.V.I.S demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YNI9pm3h6x8/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YNI9pm3h6x8)

▶ **[Watch the demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YNI9pm3h6x8)** — live transcription, agent tool calls, holographic media panels, and the cinematic boot, all in real time.

## What it does


Click the ring and speak. Your words transcribe **live on screen** while you
talk. The transcript goes to Hermes Agent, which actually *does things* — reads
and writes files, runs commands, searches the web, remembers you across
sessions — and the reply streams back as speech, sentence by sentence, while
the rest is still being generated. Typical round trip: 3–5 seconds.

The HUD around the ring is a real control center:

- **Live agent activity** — watch tool calls happen with command previews
- **STOP button** — halt a runaway agent turn mid-tool-call (Esc works too)
- **Approval cards** — dangerous commands pause for your ALLOW/DENY
- **Interrupt-aware barge-in** — cut it off mid-sentence; it knows exactly
  what you heard and what you didn't
- **Embedded dashboards** — Hermes' kanban board and session browser pop up
  in animated viewers, fully interactive
- **Holographic media panels** — say *"show me a video of how arc reactors
  work, on screen"* and a panel swoops in from Z-depth, traces its frame,
  materializes through a scanline, and plays the video. The agent drives it
  through a bundled Hermes plugin (`hud_display`); panels can fly into
  left/right thirds, and "clear the screen" sweeps them away
- **Proactive speech** — Jarvis talks *unprompted*. `POST /api/say` (or the
  `jarvis_say` agent tool) synthesizes and speaks on every open HUD outside a
  turn — reminders, alerts, "the build finished, sir" — with `priority:high` to
  barge in. A built-in scheduler fires spoken morning/evening briefings whose
  content the agent generates (`proactive:` in `server.yaml`)
- **Data panels** — beyond media, the agent can throw up inline bar/line
  **charts** (`hud_chart`) and key/value **status boards** (`hud_glance`) —
  rendered as SVG in-panel, no external site
- **Usage tracking** — tokens/day, turns, ElevenLabs quota bar
- **Machines panel** — live CPU/GPU stats for the host and remote workers
- **Cinematic boot** — press `B`: panels flicker in, ring spins up,
  "Systems online. Good morning."
- **Persona + earcons** — a dry, butler-flavored J.A.R.V.I.S. voice (fallback
  persona), synthesized UI sound cues on listen/alert/error/incoming-speech,
  and a spoken "on it, sir" filler if the agent takes a beat to reply
  (`hermes.ack_after_seconds`)
- **Privacy filter** — secret-shaped strings are redacted before any text
  reaches cloud TTS
- **Optional GPU ears** — point it at any NVIDIA machine on your LAN running
  the included sidecar and transcription jumps to `large-v3-turbo` at ~0.2 s,
  with automatic fallback to local Whisper when that machine is off
- **Mobile-ready** — responsive layout + Add to Home Screen = full-screen
  Jarvis app on your phone

One brain, many faces: voice and typed chat share a single persistent Hermes
session, so each knows what you said to the other — and memory survives every
restart.

## Requirements

- A machine for the server (tested: Mac mini, Apple Silicon). Linux should
  work with minor changes (launchd → systemd).
- [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) installed and
  configured with an LLM provider
- Python 3.11+
- An [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) API key (free tier works; ~0.5
  credits/char on Flash)
- Any modern browser on the LAN

## Install

Full walkthrough in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md). Short version:

```bash
# 1. Enable the Hermes Agent API server
cat >> ~/.hermes/.env <<EOF
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_KEY=$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')
JARVIS_HUD_TOKEN=$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print("jarvis-"+secrets.token_hex(3))')
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here
EOF
hermes gateway   # or set up its LaunchAgent / service

# 2. This repo
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/jarvis-hermes-hud
cd jarvis-hermes-hud/server
python3 -m venv .venv
# STT is direct faster-whisper (CTranslate2) — no torch, no RealtimeSTT, no
# silero-vad. Optional on-device TTS fallback: also `pip install piper-tts
# onnxruntime` (and `audioop-lts` on Python 3.13+). See docs/SETUP.md.
.venv/bin/pip install fastapi uvicorn requests pyyaml numpy anthropic \
    faster-whisper websockets psutil
cp config/server.example.yaml config/server.yaml   # edit: your ElevenLabs voice_id etc.
scripts/make-certs.sh                              # self-signed TLS (browser mic needs it)
scripts/make-boot-audio.sh YourName                # one-time boot greeting synthesis

# 3. Run
.venv/bin/python server.py
# open https://YOUR_HOST/hud/ → accept cert → enter your JARVIS_HUD_TOKEN → talk
```

For auto-start on boot, see [launchd/](launchd/) (macOS) — the plists document
two non-obvious macOS traps (external-drive TCC and log paths) that cost us an
evening.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Talk | Click the ring (or Space) · speak · click again to send |
| Stop the agent | red ■ STOP button or Esc |
| Barge in | click the ring while it's speaking |
| Typed chat | input bar at the bottom (same conversation as voice) |
| Cinematic boot | press `B` |
| Kanban / dashboards | VIEWS panel → animated pop-up viewers |
| Phone | open the HUD → Add to Home Screen |

## Repo layout

```
server/          FastAPI voice pipeline + HUD host (the core of this project)
server/hud/      single-file HUD (vanilla JS, no build step)
server/scripts/  start/stop/health/smoke + cert & boot-audio generators
client/          optional Windows/Linux push-to-talk Python client (wake word capable)
worker/          optional GPU sidecars: big-model STT server + stats agent for the Machines panel
hermes-plugin/   Hermes tool plugin: lets the agent summon/dismiss HUD media panels
customer-onboarding/ reviewed input templates for separate customer profiles
scripts/         customer package builder and integration setup helpers
launchd/         macOS auto-start templates with hard-won TCC + FD-limit notes
docs/            SETUP, ARCHITECTURE (protocols/endpoints), TROUBLESHOOTING
```

To prepare a separate customer installation without copying private runtime
state, use the native Hermes distribution builder documented in
[docs/CUSTOMER-ONBOARDING-PACKAGE.md](docs/CUSTOMER-ONBOARDING-PACKAGE.md).

## Security model

- The Hermes API key never reaches the browser: the HUD talks through a
  strict allowlist proxy on the voice server.
- All HUD endpoints + dashboard proxy + browser WebSockets are gated by a
  token (cookie, entered once per device).
- Hermes' API binds to loopback only; the dashboard binds to loopback only.
- Secret-shaped strings are redacted before text leaves for cloud TTS.
- LAN-only by design — do not port-forward this to the internet.
