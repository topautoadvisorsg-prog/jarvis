# Full Setup Guide

Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) with Hermes Agent v0.16. Allow ~1 hour.

## 1. Hermes Agent (the brain)

Install Hermes Agent and give it an LLM provider — follow the
[official quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart).
Verify `hermes` works in your terminal before continuing.

Enable its API server in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_KEY=<long random secret>      # required — full toolset incl. terminal!
```

Start the gateway (`hermes gateway`) and verify:

```bash
KEY=$(grep '^API_SERVER_KEY=' ~/.hermes/.env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
# {"status": "ok", ...}
```

Recommended: add voice-behavior rules to your global `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`
(short spoken sentences, no markdown aloud, never speak secrets, announce risky
actions and wait for approval). The agent — not the voice server — should own
its personality. A ready-made J.A.R.V.I.S. persona ships in
[`hermes-plugin/SOUL.jarvis.md`](../hermes-plugin/SOUL.jarvis.md):

```bash
cat hermes-plugin/SOUL.jarvis.md >> ~/.hermes/SOUL.md
```

## 2. ElevenLabs (the voice)

Create an API key at elevenlabs.io and pick a voice from their library, noting
its `voice_id`. Add to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
```

For the HUD's quota bar, give the key the **User → Read** permission.

## 3. The voice pipeline server (this repo)

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install fastapi uvicorn requests pyyaml numpy anthropic \
    faster-whisper websockets psutil
cp config/server.example.yaml config/server.yaml
```

STT is direct [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
(CTranslate2 — no torch, no RealtimeSTT, no silero-vad). The first start
downloads the Whisper model; subsequent starts are fast.

Optional on-device TTS fallback (used only when ElevenLabs has no usable
key + `voice.voice_id`, otherwise the server runs text-only):

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install piper-tts onnxruntime   # onnxruntime>=1.23 on macOS x86_64
.venv/bin/pip install "audioop-lts; python_version >= '3.13'"   # stdlib audioop shim
# then download a voice from https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices
# and fill in voice.local in server.yaml
```

Edit `config/server.yaml`: set `voice.voice_id`, and adjust the `machines:`
list (or delete it). The first run downloads the Whisper model (~460 MB for
`small.en`).

### TLS certificates (required for browser microphone)

Browsers only expose the mic to secure origins:

```bash
scripts/make-certs.sh            # auto-detects your LAN IP for the SAN
```

Trust `certs/cert.pem` on each device (macOS: Keychain; Windows:
`certutil -user -addstore Root cert.pem`; iPhone: download
`https://host:8765/hud/jarvis.cer`, install profile, then enable in
Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings).

Optional but nice: rename your host's mDNS name (`sudo scutil --set
LocalHostName jarvis` on macOS) so the HUD lives at `https://jarvis.local/hud/`.
Port 443 needs the wildcard bind already set in the example config.

### HUD access token

```bash
echo "JARVIS_HUD_TOKEN=jarvis-$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(3))')" >> ~/.hermes/.env
```

The HUD asks for this once per device. Omit the variable entirely to disable
auth (not recommended).

### Boot greeting (one-time, ~110 ElevenLabs characters)

```bash
scripts/make-boot-audio.sh YourFirstName
```

### Run it

```bash
scripts/jarvis-start.sh
scripts/jarvis-health.sh
```

The launcher supervises the HUD on WSL/Linux and uses the configured launchd
services on macOS. Direct `.venv/bin/python server.py` startup is for foreground
development only. Wait for the launcher health gate, then open
`https://YOUR_HOST/hud/`.

## 4. Auto-start on boot (macOS)

Copy the two plists from `launchd/`, edit the `/PATH/TO` and `YOUR_USER`
placeholders, then:

```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.voice.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.dashboard.plist
```

**Read the comments in the plists** — there are two macOS traps (external-drive
TCC permissions and log-path location) that produce silent hangs or `EX_CONFIG`
errors if ignored. Day-to-day management: `scripts/jarvis-{start,stop,restart,health}.sh`.

## 5. Optional extras

**Push-to-talk client** (Windows/Linux box with a mic):

```bash
cd client
python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/pip install sounddevice websockets numpy openwakeword
python client.py --push-to-talk --server ws://YOUR_HOST:8765/ws --list-devices
```

**GPU worker stats** (shows in the Machines panel): copy
`worker/worker_stats.py` to the worker machine, `pip install psutil`, run it,
and point a `machines:` entry's `stats_url` at `http://worker-ip:8767/stats`.

**GPU speech recognition** — the single biggest quality upgrade if you own any
NVIDIA machine on the LAN. On that machine:

```
cd worker
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install faster-whisper fastapi uvicorn nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12
copy run-stt.example.bat run-stt.bat    # fill in your JARVIS_HUD_TOKEN value
run-stt.bat
```

Then uncomment the `stt.remote:` block in the server's `server.yaml` (point
`url` at the GPU machine) and restart the voice server. Result: `large-v3-turbo`
accuracy at ~0.2 s per utterance, with automatic fallback to the local model
whenever the GPU machine is off. For auto-start at Windows logon, drop a
`JarvisSTT.vbs` in `shell:startup` (template in the .bat comments).

**Phone app feel**: open the HUD in Safari/Chrome on your phone →
Share → Add to Home Screen.

**Let the agent put things on your screen** (the showstopper): install the
bundled Hermes plugin so "show me a video of X on screen" makes holographic
media panels materialize on every open HUD:

```bash
cp -R hermes-plugin/hud_display ~/.hermes/plugins/hud_display
# edit ~/.hermes/plugins/hud_display/schemas.py: replace YOUR_HOST
hermes plugins enable hud_display     # repeat with -p <profile> if you use profiles
# restart your hermes gateway
```

The plugin needs `JARVIS_HUD_TOKEN` in `~/.hermes/.env` (same token as the
HUD). Directory name must stay a valid Python module name — hyphens silently
break plugin discovery. The agent then has `hud_display` / `hud_dismiss`
tools; YouTube links play as embedded video, `position` left/right lets it
fly in multiple panels from different vectors.

## 6. Verify everything

```bash
scripts/jarvis-health.sh   # all five rows OK
scripts/jarvis-smoke.sh    # synthesized voice turn through the full stack (macOS)
```

Then the real test: click the ring and ask "what's in your memory file?" —
a real agent answers with real file contents.

## 7. Internal rollback package

After the working tree is clean and the intended checkpoint is committed, build
and immediately verify a secret-free source rollback package:

```bash
python server/scripts/build-rollback-package.py
```

The ZIP, outer checksum, source manifest, asset hashes, and restore instructions
are written under the ignored `server/backups/` directory. See
[`JARVIS-ROLLBACK-PACKAGE.md`](JARVIS-ROLLBACK-PACKAGE.md) for the recovery
boundary and verification command.
